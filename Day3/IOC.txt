
What is IoC?

- IoC container: (Inversion of control)
		-It is used to create object of class,maintain life cycle of object,manage its state,  by spring. So it is called Loosely coupling, for this feature spring is more popular in market
		 - Mainly it based on two concept DI(Dependency Injection) & IOC (Inversion of control)
		 
		- IoC -- Inversion of Control
			 - It is an architectural pattern describing that programmer do not need to create an object, instead just describe how it should be created. No need to directly connect your components & services together in program, instead just describe which services are needed by which components in a configuration file/xml file. The spring IOC container is then responsible.
			- IOC create a singleton object means that object create only ones instance & we can use that object through out the application whenever we need.
			
		- DI -- Dependency Injection
			- The object initialization is done by spring -- adding dependencies into the object (i.e. initializing its properties).
			- DI is way to achieving the IOC.i.e to implement IOC we reuired Dependency Injection
			- Runtime object creation is not allowed
			- It Create Object before runtime & it inject whenever we want it gives object.
			
			
IOC Container Has 2 types

 1 BeanFactory
	- It is Interface
	- we can use some implementated classess using this interface
 2 ApplicationContext
	- It is Interface
	- we can use some implementated classess using this interface
	- Application Context is nothing but spring container.In newer version of spring Application Context to developed enterprise application.
	- class is used ClassPathXMLApplicationContext
