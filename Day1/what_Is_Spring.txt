  4 It has fix Flow it already predefined e.g. bus route is fix from katraj to swarget & swarget to katraj

Spring Framework:
	- Pre-requisits: OOP concepts & coding,core java,Introductory knowlegdge of Advanced Java.
	- Spring is light-weight comprehensive framework to Simplify Java (SE+EE) Development.
	- Light-weight -- Framework size is small + minimal num of jars (for give req.) + Minimal overheads.
		- Comprehensive -- Provides lot of functionality in minimal code.
		- Simplify Java Development -- Developer can focus on business logic, Spring manage testing, integration of other libs, ...
		- Depedency Injection
		
- Spring Framework:
		- 2003 -- Rod Johnson -- sourceforge.net -- Open Source project.
		- Spring 1.x
		- Spring 2.x
		- * Spring 3.x -- Annotation based config.
		- * Spring 4.x => 4.x.x
		- Spring 5.x
		
- Spring Features:
		- Modular -- different jars for different functionalities.
		- Flexible -- Most of frameworks follow "All or nothing" policy -- Spring is exception
		- Test Driven Development -- Unit testing is well integrated in Spring + Supprt for other testing.
		- Maintainable/Extendable -- Start with interfaces & can change impl over the time.
		- Exceptions -- Spring convert/wraps all checked exception into unchecked one.
		- Depedency Injection
